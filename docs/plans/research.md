# Research Summary: WordPress Results Block Plugin

## Users
- **Site Administrators**: Manage sports, racing, or event websites using WordPress, often with Neve or Elementor themes/builders.
- **Event Organizers**: Need to present historical results in a user-friendly, filterable format.
- **Participants & Visitors**: Seek quick access to event results, often filtered by date, distance, event type, or course.

## Problem Statements
- **Manual Results Management**: Current solutions require manual creation of results pages or lack dynamic filtering, leading to outdated or hard-to-navigate content.
- **Poor Organization**: Results are often not grouped by year or presented in reverse chronological order, making recent results hard to find.
- **Limited Filtering**: Existing plugins may not support complex filter parameters, especially with range options or dynamic URL construction.
- **Block Editor Compatibility**: Many plugins are not fully compatible with modern block editors or popular themes/builders like Neve and Elementor.
- **Responsiveness**: Results blocks may not be mobile-friendly or responsive, impacting user experience.

## Unmet Needs
- **Dynamic, Database-Driven Results**: Automated generation of results blocks from a database query, reducing manual work and errors.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Ability to add multiple, customizable filter parameters (including ranges) to URLs for deep linking and sharing.
- **Customizable Link Formatting**: Support for user-defined link text and URL structure, including a 'LATEST' prefix for the most recent result.
- **Block Editor Integration**: Seamless addition of the results block via the WordPress block editor, with settings panels for configuration.
- **Theme/Builder Compatibility**: Out-of-the-box support for Neve and Elementor, ensuring consistent appearance and functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the block looks and works well on all devices.

## Feature Considerations
- **Year-Based Grouping**: Automatic grouping of results by year, with headings.
- **Custom Link Text**: Format: "{date} - {distance} Mile {event_type} ({course})".
- **Dynamic URL Construction**: User selects results page; filter parameters are appended based on block settings and query results.
- **Settings Panel**: UI for adding key-value filter pairs, with range support and clear labeling.
- **'LATEST' Prefix**: Only the first (most recent) link is marked as 'LATEST:'.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile and desktop compatibility.

## Next Steps
- Validate user needs and feature set with target users.
- Review technical feasibility for block editor, Neve, and Elementor compatibility.
- Explore existing plugins for gaps and inspiration.
